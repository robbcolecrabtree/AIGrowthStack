Perform a site-wide compliance refactor to make AuditReady.tools AdSense-compatible by enforcing a strict separation between navigation UI pages and publisher-content pages.

This must be done programmatically by iterating through all existing routes and page templates. Do NOT rely on manually enumerated pages.

======================================================================
STEP 1 — PAGE TYPE CLASSIFICATION (AUTOMATED)
======================================================================

Programmatically classify every route into one of the following types based on structure and intent:

A) Navigation / UI Pages
- Tool listings
- Category pages
- Filtered views
- Comparison tables
- Search results
- Any page where browsing, filtering, or selection is the primary action

B) Publisher / Editorial Pages
- Long-form reading experiences
- Standalone content pages
- Reviews, comparisons, and guides
- Pages where reading is the primary action

This classification must be rule-based and reusable.

======================================================================
STEP 2 — AD ENFORCEMENT RULES (GLOBAL)
======================================================================

Apply the following rules automatically based on page classification:

FOR ALL Navigation / UI Pages:
- Remove all Google AdSense ad units
- Prevent ads from rendering in:
  - Empty states
  - Filtered states
  - Loading states
  - Navigation-only screens
- These pages must NEVER display display ads

FOR ALL Publisher / Editorial Pages:
- Allow Google AdSense ads ONLY if:
  - The page contains substantial original text content
  - Content renders before ads
  - Ads are not above the fold
- Enforce a maximum ad density appropriate for long-form content

======================================================================
STEP 3 — EDITORIAL CONTENT LAYER (AUTOMATED GENERATION)
======================================================================

Introduce an editorial content layer that is programmatically generated from existing data:

- For each tool:
  - Generate a standalone Review page
- For each meaningful tool pairing:
  - Generate a Comparison page
- For each major compliance topic:
  - Generate a Guide / Explainer page

These pages must:
- Be text-first
- Be readable without interaction
- Stand alone as publisher content
- Be internally linked from navigation pages

Ads are permitted ONLY on these pages.

======================================================================
STEP 4 — INTERNAL LINKING & FUNNELING
======================================================================

Automatically update navigation pages to:
- Link prominently to relevant editorial pages
- Use language such as:
  - “Read full review”
  - “Compare tools”
  - “Learn how to choose”

Navigation pages should funnel traffic INTO publisher pages, not host ads themselves.

======================================================================
STEP 5 — SAFETY & COMPLIANCE GUARDS
======================================================================

Implement global safeguards to prevent future violations:
- Block ad rendering on any page classified as Navigation/UI
- Block ads on pages with insufficient content length
- Block ads on pages without a clear reading intent
- Ensure no ads appear on screens used primarily for navigation or behavior

======================================================================
EXECUTION CONSTRAINTS
======================================================================

- Do NOT manually enumerate routes
- Do NOT rely on hard-coded page lists
- Do NOT deploy automatically
- Treat this as a structural compliance migration

Once complete, pause and wait for manual review before suggesting deployment or AdSense reapplication.
