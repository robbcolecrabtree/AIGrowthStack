You are modifying an existing production codebase for AuditReady.

THIS IS A CANONICAL INSTRUCTION SET.
DO NOT INFER, GUESS, OR SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING NOT EXPLICITLY DEFINED BELOW.

If an entity, enum, category, or field does not exist, YOU MUST CREATE IT.
If it already exists, YOU MUST REUSE IT EXACTLY AS DEFINED.

----------------------------------------
GLOBAL RULES
----------------------------------------

- Do not hallucinate tools, categories, or fields
- Do not rename existing entities unless instructed
- Do not auto‑generate content beyond what is specified
- Do not reuse images across tools
- Do not add affiliate links or monetization language
- Do not publish any content
- All new content must be marked as DRAFT

----------------------------------------
STEP 1: DATA MODEL VERIFICATION
----------------------------------------

Verify the existence of a Tool data model.

If Tool does NOT exist, CREATE it with the following EXACT fields:

Tool:
- id (uuid)
- slug (string, unique, lowercase, hyphenated)
- name (string)
- category (enum)
- audit_domain (enum)
- short_description (string)
- long_description (text)
- primary_controls_supported (array of strings)
- compliance_frameworks (array of strings)
- evidence_produced (array of strings)
- ideal_customer (string)
- limitations (array of strings)
- outbound_slug (string)
- monetization_status (enum)
- publish_status (enum)

----------------------------------------
STEP 2: ENUM CREATION
----------------------------------------

If any enum below does NOT exist, CREATE it EXACTLY as defined.

category enum:
- GRC Platform
- Security Control
- Identity & Access
- Physical Security
- Compliance Operations
- Documentation & Evidence
- Infrastructure Control
- HR & Access Lifecycle

audit_domain enum:
- Governance
- Access Control
- Change Management
- Risk Management
- Evidence Collection
- Financial Controls
- Physical Security

monetization_status enum:
- neutral
- partnerstack-ready

publish_status enum:
- draft
- published

----------------------------------------
STEP 3: REDIRECT INFRASTRUCTURE
----------------------------------------

If a redirect handler does NOT exist, CREATE it.

Route pattern:
- /out/{tool_slug}

Behavior:
- If partner_link exists for tool → redirect to partner_link
- Else → redirect to vendor homepage

Partner links will be injected later.
NO visible affiliate indicators.

----------------------------------------
STEP 4: TOOL CREATION
----------------------------------------

Create Tool records for EACH of the following.
If a tool already exists, DO NOT DUPLICATE—UPDATE ONLY MISSING FIELDS.
