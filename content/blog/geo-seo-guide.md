# GEO is the New SEO: How to Get Your Brand Cited by Perplexity and ChatGPT Search

**Categories:** SEO, Marketing  
**Published:** February 13, 2026

Traditional search volume is declining. In 2026, the brands that win are optimizing for generative engines—Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, and their successors—where the goal isn't ranking pages. It's powering answers.

## The 25% Decline: Traditional Search Volume in 2026

Gartner predicts that traditional search volume will drop significantly as AI search takes over in 2026. Users aren't typing queries into Google the same way anymore. They're asking Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Claude—and expecting cited, synthesized answers. If your brand isn't in those answers, you're invisible. The 25% decline isn't a theory. It's already happening. The question is: how do you show up when the answer engine decides what to cite?

## SEO vs. GEO: Ranking Pages vs. Powering Answers

SEO optimized for page rank. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) optimizes for *citations*. The goal shifts: you're not trying to land on page one of a results list. You're trying to be one of the sources an AI model chooses when it synthesizes an answer. That means different tactics. Different metrics. Different tools.

- **SEO** = Rank pages in SERPs
- **GEO** = Get cited in AI-generated answers

## The 3 Pillars of GEO

### 1. Semantic Footprint (Topic Clusters)

AI models map topics semantically. They look for authority across a *cluster* of related content—not just one page. Build topic clusters that cover your domain deeply. A single pillar page isn't enough. You need supporting content that signals comprehensive coverage.

### 2. Fact-Density (Information Gain)

Models prefer sources that add *information gain*—concrete data, stats, definitions, and specifics. Fluffy thought leadership gets skipped. Dense, factual content gets cited. Prioritize data-rich pages: benchmarks, research, case studies, clear definitions.

### 3. Structured Data (Schema.org)

Schema.org markup helps AI models parse and trust your content. Product, Organization, Article, FAQ—structured data signals what your page is about and how it should be used in answers. It's not just for rich snippets anymore.

## How to Win Citations: Earned Media and Brand Mentions

Old-school backlinks still matter for SEO. But for 2026 AI models, **earned media** and **brand mentions** on Reddit, forums, and trusted communities matter more. Why? AI models ingest Reddit, Hacker News, and niche forums as signals of real-world relevance. A mention in a high-quality discussion is often worth more than a nofollow link from a thin blog.

- **Reddit and forums** — Authentic discussions where your brand is recommended or discussed
- **Expert roundups** — Being cited as an authority in third-party content
- **PR and earned media** — Press mentions, analyst citations, and industry recognition
