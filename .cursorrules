AIGrowthStack.io Project Rules

Tech Stack & Architecture
Framework: React with TypeScript and Vite.

Styling: Tailwind CSS.

Routing: React Router (SPA). Always ensure all paths point to index.html for client-side routing to prevent 404s on refresh.

Data Source: All tool data, affiliate links, and website URLs must be stored in and retrieved from client/src/lib/mockData.ts.

Routing & Redirection Rules
All external links to vendors must go through the /go/:id route.

The logic for /go/:id is:

If affiliateLink exists in mockData.ts, use it.

If affiliateLink is empty, fallback to websiteUrl.

Always use target="_blank" and rel="sponsored nofollow" for affiliate links.

Content & Branding
Voice: Professional, growth-focused, and founder-led.

Perspective: Focus on B2B marketing, scalability, and AI efficiency.

Formatting: Use 'Last updated: Feb 2026' on all blog and product review pages.

Images: Use Clearbit API ([domain]) for all tool logos.

Development Constraints
Project Context: This is a professional directory for AI tools.

Clean State: Do not reference or display 'Audit' or placeholder articles. Only show the 5 new SEO pillar posts.

SEO: Every page must include unique meta titles and descriptions via the SEO component.
